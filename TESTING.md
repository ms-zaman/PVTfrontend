// Test cases to implement
describe('MapView', () => {
  it('renders map container');
  it('displays event markers');
  it('handles marker clicks');
  it('respects map bounds');
  it('shows loading state');
});
```

### FiltersSidebar Component
```typescript
describe('FiltersSidebar', () => {
  it('renders all filter sections');
  it('handles filter changes');
  it('applies filters correctly');

});
```

## Integration Testing

### Data Flow Testing

- [ ] Dark mode state persists

### User Journey Testing
1. **Basic Usage**
   - User loads the page
   - Map displays with events
   - User clicks on an event
   - Popup shows event details

2. **Filtering Workflow**
   - User opens filters sidebar
   - Selects date range
   - Chooses political parties
   - Applies filters
   - Map updates with filtered events

3. **Mobile Experience**
   - User visits on mobile device
   - Sidebar is collapsed
   - User taps menu to open filters
   - Touch interactions work on map
   - Popups are readable

## Automated Testing Setup

### Install Testing Dependencies
```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jest jest-environment-jsdom
```

### Jest Configuration
```javascript
// jest.config.js
const nextJest = require('next/jest')

const createJestConfig = nextJest({
  dir: './',
})

const customJestConfig = {
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],
  moduleNameMapping: {
    '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/$1',
  },
  testEnvironment: 'jest-environment-jsdom',
}

module.exports = createJestConfig(customJestConfig)
```

### Test Setup
```javascript
// jest.setup.js
import '@testing-library/jest-dom'

// Mock Leaflet
global.L = {
  map: jest.fn(),
  tileLayer: jest.fn(),
  marker: jest.fn(),
  popup: jest.fn(),
};
```
